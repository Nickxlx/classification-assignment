    "Q1. What is the purpose of grid search cv in machine learning, and how does it work?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer--> The purpose of GridSearchCV (Grid Search Cross-Validation) in machine learning is to systematically search for the best optimal combination of hyperparameters for a given model. It automates the process of hyperparameter tuning, which involves selecting the optimal values for hyperparameters to maximize model performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "GridSearchCV works by exhaustively trying all possible combinations of hyperparameter values from a predefined grid. It performs cross-validation on each combination to evaluate the model's performance. We can use to get our model with best accuracy prediction with optimal parameters. "

    "\n",
    "Answer--> Here's a comparison between the two:\n",
    "\n",
    "1 GridSearchCV:\n",
    "\n",
    "- GridSearchCV exhaustively searches through all possible combinations of hyperparameter values specified in a predefined grid.\n",
    "- It systematically evaluates the model performance for each combination using cross-validation.\n",
    "\n",
    "2 RandomizedSearchCV:\n",
    "\n",
    "- RandomizedSearchCV randomly samples a specified number of combinations from the hyperparameter search space.\n",
    "- RandomizedSearchCV does not evaluate all possible combinations like GridSearchCV but randomly selects a subset of combinations.\n",
    "\n",
    "When to Choose One over the Other:\n",
    "\n",
    "- GridSearchCV is preferred when you have a relatively small hyperparameter space and computational resources are not a constraint. It guarantees an exhaustive search and is suitable for fine-tuning the hyperparameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "- RandomizedSearchCV is preferred when the hyperparameter space is large or when computational resources are limited. It allows for a more efficient exploration of the hyperparameter space, providing a good chance of finding promising hyperparameter configurations without evaluating all possible combinations."

    "Q3. What is data leakage, and why is it a problem in machine learning? Provide an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer--> Data leakage refers to the unintentional or improper introduction of information from outside the modeling timeframe into the training data, leading to overly optimistic model performance or incorrect inferences. It occurs when information that would not be available during real-world prediction is mistakenly included in the training process.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data leakage is a problem in machine learning because it violates the fundamental assumption that the model should only learn from information available at the time of prediction. It can lead to inflated performance metrics during training, but the model may fail to generalize well to new, unseen data. Data leakage can result in models that are overfitted to specific patterns or relationships present in the training data but not in real-world scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example of Data Leakage:\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's consider an example where we want to predict whether a customer will churn or not based on their usage data. In the dataset, we have features like call duration, data usage, and monthly charges. We also have a target variable indicating whether the customer has churned or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, suppose we accidentally include the feature \"customer status at the end of the month\" in the training data. This feature captures the information about whether a customer has churned or not, which is essentially the same as the target variable but from the future. By including this feature, the model would have access to future information that it wouldn't have during real-world predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a result, the model may learn the leakage pattern and achieve high accuracy during training. However, when applied to new data where the \"customer status at the end of the month\" is not available, the model would fail to generalize, leading to poor performance. This is an example of data leakage because it introduces information that would not be available in real-world scenarios and can severely impact the model's effectiveness.\n"

    "\n",

Data leakage should be avoided to build models that can generalize well to unseen data and make accurate predictions in real-world scenarios."

    "Answer--> A confusion matrix is a table that summarizes the performance of a classification model by displaying the counts of true positive (TP), true negative (TN), false positive (FP), and false negative (FN) predictions.

    "False negatives occur when the model predicts an instance as negative, but it is actually positive. These are the instances that are truly positive, but the model has incorrectly classified them as negative. False negatives are also known as Type II errors.\n",
